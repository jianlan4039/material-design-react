Setting Up the Development Environment

To contribute code, you need to set up your local development environment. Follow these steps:

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/jianlan4039/material-design-react.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

cd your-project
# Using npm
npm install
# Or using yarn
yarn install


	3.	Run tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:

npm test



Make sure your local setup is working as expected before submitting code.

Coding Standards

To ensure consistency across the codebase, please adhere to the following coding standards:

	1.	Code Formatting: Follow the project’s formatting rules (use .editorconfig, .prettierrc, etc., if provided). If not, follow these general rules:
	•	Use 2 spaces for indentation.
	•	Ensure every file ends with a newline.
	•	Keep line lengths under 80 characters where possible.
	2.	Naming Conventions:
	•	Use camelCase for JavaScript variables and functions.
	•	Use PascalCase for class names.
	•	Choose descriptive variable names instead of single-letter names like a or b.
	3.	Commenting: Write clear, concise comments where necessary to explain code logic and decisions. Use this style for comments:

// Single-line comment
/* Multi-line comment */


	4.	Testing: Ensure that your code is tested before submission. Add appropriate unit tests if you’re adding new functionality.

Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages should be clear and concise, and follow this format:

[type] - [issue number (if any)] - [brief description]

Examples:

	•	Types: feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), docs (documentation), style (formatting), refactor (code improvement), test (adding tests).
	•	Issue Number: If your commit addresses an issue, reference it in the message (e.g., Closes #123).
